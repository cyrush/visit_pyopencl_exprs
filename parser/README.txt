03/23/2012: Code to parse VisIt expressions. It currently deals with basic math ops but will eventually be expanded to account for all math, trigonometry and conditional operations.
There will also be multiple versions of this code: (1) NumPy, (2) PyOpenCL built-in ops, (3) calls to PyOpenCL kernels.
